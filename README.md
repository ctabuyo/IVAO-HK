# IVAO-HK
This is an iOS App I started developing while I was staff(HK-AWM) in the Hong Kong division of IVAO. 

# What is IVAO-HK iOS App? 

We started developing this App with the idea of letting everyone manage their IVAO account with it, and we had planned to include more
useful features in the future, such as the Squawk Generator by Clark Chen, and other tools to improve IVAO experience and Flight Simulation
in general.

Unfortunately, not everything in my life unveiled as I had hoped, so I was forced to halt the development of this app as well as resign
from my position as HK-AWM due to lack of time. 

# Why open source this project? 

I do it with the hope that although it is far from finished, and not more than a few things actually work, it will help someone who is 
planning to design something similar and/or that in the future I'll find the time to finish it.
